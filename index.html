<h1>IdentityExposed</h1>

<button class="button" onclick="location.href='instructions.html';" style="font-size:36pt;">I want to know my personality!</button>

<h2>This test gives you the closest matches in a wide variety of categories including MBTI, Enneagram, Zodiac, Archetypes, etc. Have fun!</h2>

<h2>What is IdentityExposed?</h2>
    <p>IdentityExposed is, in essence, a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages for eight different political values. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the personality traits?</h2>
    <p>There are five main traits and they are split into two facets. This test measures the ten resulting facets. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff6a00;">Assertiveness</b> (Extraversion)<br/>
        High scorers tend to be more assertive and action-oriented. Low scorers tend to be more passive and they may prefer to follow instead of lead.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffff00;">Enthusiasm</b> (Extraversion)<br/>
        High scorers are more likely to experience positive feeings and be enthusiastic about life. This doesn't mean low scorers are always grumpy and miserable. They are just less likely to have high spirits.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#cf00b3;">Compassion</b> (Agreeableness)<br/>
        High scorers tend to have emotional connections with people and they may pity others. Low scorers are less concerned about others and they have an easier time expressing cruelty.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00a621;">Politeness</b> (Agreeableness)<br/>
        Polite people tend to respect morality and they tend to cooperate. Less polite individuals tend to be more materialistic and at worst, they can be manipulative.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#006eff;">Industriousness</b> (Conscientiousness)<br/>
        People with high industriousness work hard to achieve their goals. Low scorers are more laid-back and they may be perceived as lazy by others.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#998600;">Orderliness</b> (Conscientiousness)<br/>
        People with high orderliness tend to be organized and neat. At extremes, they may be neat freaks. Low scorers tend to be more chaotic and scattered.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#523361;">Withdrawal</b> (Neuroticism)<br/>
        High scorers tend to be anxious, depressed and vulnerable. They may have difficulty initiating activities. Low scorers tend to be bolder and they may have an easier time taking risks.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffcc00;">Volatility</b> (Neuroticism)<br/>
        High volatility results in impulsive and hurtful actions under stress and they may easily get angry or irritated. Low scorers tend to be stable and they have better self-control.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00fff2;">Intellect</b> (Openness To Experience)<br/>
        High scorers tend to be intellectually curious and they enjoy thinking about ideas. Low scorers are less intellectually curious and they may have a harder time with abstract concepts. This doesn't mean they are stupid.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#77ff00;">Openness</b> (Openness To Experience)<br/>
        Open people like a variety of experiences and they tend to be imaginative and creative. Low scorers tend to be more traditional and conservative. They are more likely to prefer routine.</p>
